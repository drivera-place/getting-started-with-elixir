# First steps with Elixir

This repo contains snippets around getting started with Elixir, implementing basic concepts and features of the language and advantages of Erlang VM.

## Getting Started

To get started with Elixir, you need to have Elixir installed on your machine. You can follow the official installation guide [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

Once you have Elixir installed, you can start an interactive shell (IEx) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
iex
```

or

```bash
iex -S mix
```

To start an Elixir project, you can use the Mix build tool. Create a new project by running:

```bash
mix new my_project
cd my_project
```

Formating files can be done using:

```bash
mix format
```

To run tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
mix test
```

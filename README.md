# First steps with Elixir

This repo contains snippets around getting started with Elixir, implementing basic concepts and features of the language and advantages of Erlang VM.

## Getting Started

To get started with Elixir, you need to have Elixir installed on your machine. You can follow the official installation guide [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

Once you have Elixir installed, you can start an interactive shell (IEx) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
iex
```

or

```bash
mix -S iex
```
